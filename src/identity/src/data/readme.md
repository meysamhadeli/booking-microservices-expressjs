## How to Use Migrations
> Note: For easy using of migrations commands in typeorm, I add some scripts in `package.json` and base on these scripts we can use below commands to generate and run migrations easily.

For `generating` a new migration use this command in the root of each microservice:

```bash
npm run migration:generate -- src/data/migrations/new-migration-name
```

Also for `running` migration use this command in the root of each microservice:
```bash
npm run migration:run
```
